Issues
1. Inconsistent typing: The `blockchain` parameter in `getPriority` is typed as `any`, which defeats the purpose of using TypeScript.
2. Unnecessary re-renders: `useMemo` is used, but its dependency array only includes `balances` and `prices`, while it also depends on `getPriority`.
3. Incorrect logic in `sortedBalances`: The filter condition is always `false` because it returns `true` only when `balance.amount <= 0`, but then returns `false` for all other cases.
4. Inefficient sorting: The sort function doesn't handle the case when priorities are equal, which can lead to inconsistent sorting.
5. Duplicate calculations: `getPriority` is called twice for each balance in the sort function.
6. Unnecessary mapping: `formattedBalances` is created but never used.
7. Inefficient use of `map`: `rows` are created using `map` on `sortedBalances`, but it should use `formattedBalances` instead.
8. Anti-pattern in key usage: Using array index as key in React lists can lead to performance issues and bugs with dynamic lists.
9. Prop spreading: The `...rest` spread in the return statement can potentially pass unwanted props to the div.

Improvements in the refactored:

1. Replaced `getPriority` function with a `BLOCKCHAIN_PRIORITIES` object for better performance and type safety.
2. Fixed the filter logic to correctly handle priorities and positive balances.
3. Improved sorting by using the difference between priorities.
4. Combined filtering, sorting, and formatting into a single `useMemo` hook for better performance.
5. Removed unused `formattedBalances` and directly use the result of `useMemo`.
6. Used a combination of blockchain and currency as the key for `WalletRow` components.
7. Removed unnecessary prop spreading and only passed the `className` prop.
8. Improved TypeScript typing throughout the component.
9. Moved `usdValue` calculation into the `useMemo` hook to avoid recalculation in render.
